LINKED LIST:
A linked list is a sequence of nodes where each node contains two parts:
    Data: The value stored in the node.
    Pointer: A reference to the next node in the sequence.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
 Types of Linked List in C:
    1.Singly Linked List
    2.Doubly Linked List
    3.Circular Linked List
    
SINGLY LINKED LIST IN C:
      A linked list or singly linked list is a linear data structure that is made up of a group of nodes in which each node has two parts: the data, and the pointer to the next node.The last node's (also known as tail) pointers point to NULL to indicate the end of the linked list.
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Representation of Singly Linked List in C:
          Data: Here the actual information is stored.
          Next: Pointer that links to the next node.
    
// Structure to represent the singly linked list
struct Node {
  
  // Data field - can be of any type and count
  int data;
  
  // Pointer to the next node
  Node* next;
}



DOUBLY LINKED LIST IN C:
In it, each node contains three parts: the data, a pointer to the next node, and one extra pointer which points to the previous node. This allows for traversal in both directions, making it more versatile than a singly linked list.













Representation of Doubly Linked List in C:
    Data: The actual information stored in the node.
    Next: A pointer that links to the next node in the sequence.
    Previous: A pointer that links to the previous node in the sequence.

 
    // Structure to represent the doubly linked list
struct Node {
  
  // Data field - can be of any type and count
  int data;
  
  // Pointer to the next node
  Node* next;
  
  // Pointer to the previous node
  Node* prev;
}

    

CIRCULAR LINKED LIST IN C:
A circular linked list is a variation of a singly linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. This means there is no NULL at the end, and the list can be traversed in a circular manner.











Representation of Circular Linked List in C:
    Data: The actual information stored in the node.
    Next: A pointer that links to the next node, with the last node pointing back to the first node.
    
    // Structure to represent the circular linked list
struct Node {
  
  // Data field - can be of any type and count
  int data;
  
  // Pointer to the next node
  Node* next;
}
